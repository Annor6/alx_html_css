# Headphones — ALX HTML & CSS Project

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Specialization**, focusing on translating a complete **Figma design** into a fully responsive website using **semantic HTML** and **modern CSS techniques**.

The goal is to understand how to interpret design documents, implement responsive layouts, and match the designer’s intention as closely as possible.

## 📌 Project Overview

The website design was provided in Figma, and the task required duplicating the file into our drafts and studying all layout, font, color, and spacing details.

This project strengthens the ability to:

- Work directly from professional UI/UX design files  
- Apply consistent spacing, typography, and colors  
- Build fully responsive layouts  
- Follow developer-friendly folder and code structures  
- Implement hover, active, and mobile states

## 🎨 Figma Resources

- **Main Figma Project:** (Link provided in the exercise)
- **If access is restricted**, an alternative Figma file was provided.
- **Required fonts:**
  - *Source Sans Pro*
  - *Spin Cycle OT*

Ensure these fonts are installed locally so Figma displays the design correctly.

## 📱 Responsive Requirements

The website must behave exactly as specified:

| Interaction / Requirement | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Mobile Switch** | Page switches to mobile layout when viewport ≤ **480px** |
| **Link Hover / Active** | `#FF6565` |
| **Button Hover / Active** | `opacity: 0.9` |
| **Max content width** | **1000px** — centered on page |

These rules ensure the website aligns with the intended user experience.
